            Dare to face your darkest fears on Bugsy's Haunted Trail, the scariest Halloween attraction of the year! Winding deep through a forgotten forest, this terrifying trail is haunted by the spirits of Bugsy and his minions—creatures that lurk in the shadows, waiting to prey on your deepest fears. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Legend has it that Bugsy, a notorious gangster from the 1920s, met a gruesome end in these woods after betraying his partners in crime. His ghost, twisted by revenge, now haunts the trail, bringing with him an army of supernatural terrors. From the eerie whispers of the trees to sudden encounters with Bugsy's ghastly henchmen, every step is a plunge into the unknown.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Will you survive the night, or will you become Bugsy's next victim?
